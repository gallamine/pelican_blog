<p><strong>EDUCATION </strong><br />Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Dec. 2011); 3.72/4.0 GPA<br />M.S. in Electrical Engineering (12/2007); 4.0/4.0 GPA<br />B.S. in Electrical Engineering (06/2006); 3.92/4.0 GPA</p>
<p><strong>WORK EXPERIENCE<br /></strong><br />Underwater freespace optical communication system development;<br />Photonics lab, Dr. John Muth (2006 &ndash; present)</p>
<ul>
<li>Design FPGA-based transmitter for on-off keying at 10 Mbps. Streams data from PC over USB port. Uses Verilog and Altera FPGA.</li>
<li>Design PMT based receiver for optical baseband signals.</li>
<li>Design/tested digital optical polarization modulation system for underwater communication using 405 nm diode lasers.</li>
<li>Created PSK transmitter for modulating retroreflector system. Wrote PSK receiver in MATLAB. Transmitter operating up to 1 Mbps.</li>
<li>Wrote Monte Carlo simulation of photon movement through water. Processes infinite number of photons in 4e6 blocks through variable number of scattering events. Infinite receivers on plane. Verified simulation with experimental results. Written in MATLAB and scales linearly with number of photons and scattering events.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Real-time streaming video link implemented with GNU Radio. Utilizes LED, modulating retroreflector, or diode laser link for transmitter. Transmits up to 4 Mbps with GMSK modulation.</li>
